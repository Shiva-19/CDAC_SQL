4)There is no particular order in which SQL stores the records.
  Rows of a table are not stored sequentially.
  Rows of a table are scattered (fragmentated) all over the database server Hard disk .
  When you insert into a table wherever  the system finds the free space in the database server HD, it will store 
  the row there the reason that RDBMS does this is to speed up the insert statement.
  When you select a table , the order of row in the output depends on the row address.
  When you update a row , if the row length is increasing , then the entire row may be moved to some 
  other address later when you select from the table,you will find the row at some other position in the output.
  Therefore it is not possible for to find first five rows in a table.
